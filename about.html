    <h1>💖 About This Game</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to the ultimate playful love quiz — where every card leads to one name: <span class="rohan">Rohan</span>. 💘
    </p>
    <p>
      This game was built for fun, flirtation, and a sprinkle of drama. Choose a card, reveal your hidden love, and see if <span class="rohan">Rohan</span> feels the same. Whether you're joking with friends or secretly curious, this is your destiny deck. 🔮
    </p>
    <p>
      Created with 💻 HTML, CSS, JavaScript — and an unhealthy obsession with <span class="rohan">Rohan</span>. 😏
